## Introduction

The office code of [Landslide susceptibility mapping and dynamic response along the Sichuan-Tibet transportation corridor using deep learning algorithms](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106866).
 
The current branch has been tested under PaddlePaddle 2.x and CUDA 10.2, supports Python 3.8+, and is compatible with most CUDA versions.

### Dependencies

- Linux or Windows
- GDAL
- Python 3.7+
- PaddlePaddle 2.0.1 or higher
- CUDA 10.2 or higher
- other environment requirements are updating

### /Common_use：All codes

### Just run *main_use.py* or *main_use_txt.py and parameters.txt*.

```shell
python main_use.py
or
python main_use_txt.py
```

### Other specific file descriptions will updates in the further.
